# netlify.toml
# This file tells Netlify how to build and deploy your site.

[build]
  # Specifies the directory Netlify should publish.
  # "." means the root directory of your repository.
  publish = "."

  # Specifies the build command. Since your React code is transformed
  # in the browser by Babel, no complex build step is needed here.
  # This 'echo' command simply prints a message and succeeds.
  command = "echo 'No server-side build command needed; React/Babel is in-browser.'"

# You can add more configurations here if needed,
# such as redirects, environment variables, etc.
# For now, this minimal setup is ideal for your project.
